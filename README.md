# KotlinUsers

First approach to Kotlin project with Recyclerview + Retrofit + MVP

## Description

In this project we will learn how to do a simple app with an Api call and set results in a recyclerview:

We ask to https://randomuser.me/ for some random users and set all of them into cards inside a recyclerview

We will do it with a simple MVP structure and using retrofit to do async calls and populate results to view when Api call is complete

## Used Resources

- RxJava
- Glide
- Retrofit
- de.hdodenhof.circleimageview.CircleImageView
- Users provided by https://randomuser.me/
